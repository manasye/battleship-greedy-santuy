# Game Engine

## Notes on alternative compilation
GameEngine rebuild for those who don't like guis.
In case you're a `mono/C#` newcomer see the Makefile that may assist in rebuilding the GameEngine from scratch and running test matches (especially on linux).

```bash
  make deps  # call Nuget for all package configs in the build tree.
  make clean all # build the game engine
```
