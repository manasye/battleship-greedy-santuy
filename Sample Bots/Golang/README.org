* Notes on alternative compilation

** GameEngine rebuild for those who don't like guis.
In case you're a =mono/C#= newcomer here is a small Makefile that may assist in rebuilding the GameEngine from scratch and running test matches.

See the Makefile at =GameEngine/Battleships/Makefile= which is used as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make deps  # call Nuget for all package configs in the build tree.
  make clean-objs all runbots  # run, modify, repeat
#+END_SRC

** Cross compilation of Windows Golang target from Linux

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /some_refbot_dir/go/gobot.exe main.go
#+END_SRC


* Compilation notes 
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    pushd /home/stephan/source/entelect-2017/2017-Battleships/Sample\ Bots/Golang &&  go build -o main -a .  && popd
  #+END_SRC
